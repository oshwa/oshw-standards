## Abstract
This standard defines Configuration Management (CM) requirements for US Army acquisition programs which apply throughout the lifecycle of systems and their Configuration Items (CIs) and provides the principles to acquire CM processes and products consistently across the Army. This standard implements the principles of ANSI/EIA-649 (Rev B) Configuration Management Standard and the requirements of DOD Instruction 5000.02 for CM practices.
